## Teleport game in 3D (OpenGL)

This is an old OpenGL project, which is made with GLUT because I have an 12 year old notebook which does not support modern OpenGL, such as 3.3
 This was only tested on Ubuntu, nothing else
 Install dependencies with these commands:
 ```
 sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev g++ gdb mesa-utils

 ```
The build procedure is also simple:
```shell
> g++ *.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut -g -o program
> ./program
```
**Done!**
